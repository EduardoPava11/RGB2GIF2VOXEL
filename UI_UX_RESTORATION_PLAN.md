# UI/UX Restoration Plan for RGB2GIF2VOXEL

## Current Working State
The app is now restored to the last known working commit with SimplifiedCameraView as the main interface.

## Key UI/UX Features (Working)
1. **Camera Preview**: Square preview with overlay indicators
2. **Capture Flow**:
   - Clear visual status (ready, capturing, processing, saving, complete)
   - Progress bar showing capture/processing percentage
   - Frame counter (X/256 frames)
3. **Processing Options**: Dual path selection (Rust FFI vs Swift native)
4. **Success Feedback**: Clear success overlay when GIF is saved

## Configuration for iPhone 17 Pro
To adapt for iPhone 17 Pro with square front camera:

### Camera Changes Needed:
```swift
// In SimplifiedCameraViewModel.configureSession()
// Change from:
guard let camera = AVCaptureDevice.default(.builtInWideAngleCamera, for: .video, position: .back)

// To:
guard let camera = AVCaptureDevice.default(.builtInWideAngleCamera, for: .video, position: .front)
```

### Frame Count Adjustment:
- Current: 256 frames
- Required: 128 frames
- Change `frameCount < 256` to `frameCount < 128` in capture logic

## UI/UX Best Practices

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Action**: Large, centered capture button
2. **Status Information**: Top bar with minimal text
3. **Progress Feedback**: Linear progress bar during operations
4. **Error States**: Clear alert dialogs with actionable messages

### Color Scheme
- Recording: Red border animation
- Processing: Orange status indicator
- Success: Green indicator
- Error: Red indicator

### User Flow
```
Ready State → Tap Capture → Recording (with progress) →
Processing Selection → Processing (with progress) →
Success (with save/share options) → Return to Ready
```

## Testing the Restored App

1. Build and run in simulator:
```bash
xcodebuild -project RGB2GIF2VOXEL.xcodeproj \
  -scheme RGB2GIF2VOXEL \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -configuration Debug \
  build
```

2. Open in Xcode and run on simulator
3. Grant camera permissions when prompted
4. Test capture flow end-to-end

## Benefits of SimplifiedCameraView
- Clean, focused interface
- Clear visual feedback at every step
- Minimal cognitive load
- Progressive disclosure of options
- Error recovery built-in

## Not Needed (Removed Complexity)
- StreamlinedCaptureFlow.swift (overly complex)
- Multiple view controllers
- Redundant capture interfaces
- Confusing navigation patterns

The app is now in a clean, working state with SimplifiedCameraView providing a clear, intuitive user experience.
